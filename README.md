# space-data-scraper
This is a scraper program that scrapes space data from various sources
such as spaceweatherlive and NOAA. The user can do various things with this data that
is scraped, which includes viewing the raw data and viewing them in graphs.

The repository contains several files which contain the backend and frontend for the scraping of these various 
datasets. The flask_app file is the main program that runs the web application. The web application is how you interact with our program.
# Running the Program
