# space-data-scraper
This is a scraper program that scrapes space data from various sources
such as spaceweatherlive and NOAA. The user can do various things with this data that
is scraped, which includes viewing the raw data and viewing them in graphs.

The repository contains several files which contain the backend and frontend for the scraping of these various 
datasets. The CLI python file is the main program that is interacted with.
# Running the Program
To use our space data scraper you can visit our website <a href = "http://96.255.219.52/">here</a>

To run the tests:

# Navigating the Website
First begin by visiting the website listed in the section above. This will take you to the home page.
From there, there are numerous tabs that will direct you to various information related to space data.
Currently, the tabs that are supported are the Space Weather tab, feed tab and sources tab. Clicking 
on the space weather tab will direct you to a directory page which has various buttons that lead to different
graphs. You can click on the buttons to show the graphs you want to see. The feed tab currently
displays all space weather information all in one place, with further updates to it coming in the future.
The sources tab lists all the sources we scraped our data off of.
